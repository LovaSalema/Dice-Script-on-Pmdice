# Dice-Script-on-Pmdice
Dice script is a javascript code allow to manipulate or play dice automatically


ABOUT pmdiceScript:

Pmdice script is a javascript code to manipulate bets on pmdice.com (crypto casino) automatically.

It is the main reason why I studied computer science in HEI(Haute Ecole d'Informatique Antananarivo Madagascar).

This project begins on my dream in 2021, it is about to make money while asleep!

but also the desire to apply probability and statistics on real life!

If you want to understand the game, think of head and tail (pile ou face),

But pmdice is more advanced than head and tail because chance and payout are changeable!

HOW TO USE?

Just copy and paste the script to the console F12 in Google chrome or other browser similar on pmdice.com (you can open a new account and set you e-mail and password)
and you can deposit some dollar with perfect money (2$ for example and test the script with password: TesT)
